### Experiments (section 3 in paper)

• 3.1) Interpretability: `interpret.ipynb`

• 3.2) Uniform sampling table: `sl_table.ipynb`

• 3.3) Non-uniform Sampling
  - 3.3.2) Table: `biased_table.ipynb`
  - 3.3.2) Error for different sections of the search space: `biased.ipynb`
  - 3.3.3) Performance for varying out of distribution samples: `biased_levels.ipynb`

### Data
Crossed barrel & Cogni-e-Spin datasets are in `data` directory (we cannot make the lattice dataset public due to the authors' institutional regulations)

### Tensor Completion Models
Tensor completion models used are in `tensor_completion_models` directory
